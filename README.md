Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using Machine Learning:

Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial for managing and delaying its progression. However, due to the variety of symptoms and associated risk factors, diagnosing Alzheimer's in the early stages can be challenging.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management of Alzheimer's, and our model aims to classify patients based on their likelihood of having the disease, thereby aiding medical professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project originates from a private source but has been anonymized and made public to protect patient identities. It includes various features such as patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle habits, and cognitive test results. The dataset is publicly accessible and can be downloaded from the following link:

Solution Overview
To address the problem, we will:

Analyze each variable: Explore distributions, correlations, and significance.
Transform the data: Handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
Train and evaluate the model: Test various classification algorithms, optimize hyperparameters, and select the best-performing model.
Deploy the model: Implement the trained model for real-time predictions and set up continuous monitoring for performance tracking.# Alzheimers_disease_clasification
